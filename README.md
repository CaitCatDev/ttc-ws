# TTC WS:
TTC WS orginally called LCWS(Lighweight C WebSockets) is a relatively simple and light websocket implementation in C indeeded to be used by the TTC discord bot. However this module is development with care and attention that it can easily be used on it's own by itself without the need for the rest of the discord bot.

This means you can easily drag and drop it into your project with little to no effort required to do so

Currently only client side is supported but we do plan to add a server side interface.

# How to use:
Please see the man page TTC WS for a detailed description of how the library works and what functions you are going to want to call.


# Problems:
If you encounter any issues with this library please report them in github issues.
